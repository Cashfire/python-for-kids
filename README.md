2. Monty Hall Problem (simulation)
  1. write a function called prize_doors. 
  2. write a function that simulates the contestant's guesses for nsim simulations. Call this function origin_guess.
  3. write a function, open_goats, to simulate randomly revealing one of the goat doors that a contestant didn't pick.
  4. Write a function, switch_guess, that represents the strategy of always switching a guess after the goat door is opened.
  5. write a win_percentage function Calculate how much percent of times is correct, and returns the percent of correct guesses.
